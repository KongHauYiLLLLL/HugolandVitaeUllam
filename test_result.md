# Test Results - Hugoland Fantasy Adventure Game

## User Problem Statement
The user reported: "When deploying, it says there is an error"

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Issue Identification
- **Problem**: Build was failing with error "Could not resolve entry module './src/components/Skills.tsx'"
- **Root Cause**: The `vite.config.ts` file was referencing a non-existent `Skills.tsx` component in the manual chunks configuration
- **Location**: Line 112 in `/app/vite.config.ts` in the `menu-components` chunk

### 2. Solution Applied
- **Fix**: Removed the reference to `'./src/components/Skills.tsx'` from the manual chunks configuration
- **Code Change**: Updated the `menu-components` chunk to only include existing components:
  ```typescript
  'menu-components': [
    './src/components/HamburgerMenuPage.tsx',
    './src/components/GardenOfGrowth.tsx'
  ]
  ```

### 3. Verification Tests
- **Build Test**: `npm run build` - ✅ Successfully builds production bundle
- **Development Test**: `npm run dev` - ✅ Runs on http://localhost:5174
- **Production Test**: `npm run preview` - ✅ Runs on http://localhost:4173
- **PWA Features**: Service Worker and Manifest are properly working

## Application Overview

## Current Status
✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED** - The application now builds and runs successfully in both development and production modes.

### Latest Fix (Custom Spinner Error)
- **Problem**: Duplicate declaration error for "LoadingSpinner" causing build failures
- **Root Cause**: The App.tsx file had both an import of LoadingSpinner component and a local declaration with the same name
- **Solution**: Renamed the local loading component from `LoadingSpinner` to `SuspenseLoader` to avoid naming conflicts
- **Result**: Build successful, application running without errors

## Next Steps
All deployment and runtime errors have been fixed. The application is fully functional and ready for use.
